This collection of files is downloaded and installed by the Kexow-install script

These files are the Kexow website, except for pydio, usercake, and guacamole

Pydio, guacamole, and usercake get 'forked' on github, and the kexow-install script downoads from the forked repo


this is not yet the case, now the files are static and stored all together
the thrid option is to download them directly instead of forking, thats what we will do next.
apprently you can apt-get pydio whcih is less robust and more difficult, so fuck that
but its not on github so my fork will be the first i guess
