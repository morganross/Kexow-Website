This collection of files is downloaded and installed by the Kexow-install script

These files are the Kexow website, except for pydio, usercake, and guacamole

Pydio, guacamole, and usercake get 'forked' on github, and the kexow-install script downoads from the forked repo


this is not yet the case, now the files are static and stored all together
